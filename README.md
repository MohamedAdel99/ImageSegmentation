# ImageSegmentation
Main idea is to segment images, Image segmentation means that we can group similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping problem is a clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means and Spectral Clustering on the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark.
#Phases

2-Image and Ground truth Visualization.
3-Segmentation Using K-means.
4-Segmentation Using Normalized Cut.
5-Compare 3 & 4.
6-Encoding the Spatial Layout of the pixels.
